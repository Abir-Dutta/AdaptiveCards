# .NET Libraries for creating cards
As we described in the getting started section, an adaptive card is nothing more then a serialized json object of 
a card object model.  To make it easy to manipulate the object model we have defined some libraries which 
define a strongly typed class hierarchy that is easy to serialize/deserialize json.

You can use any tooling that you want to create the adaptive card json.

## .NET 
The **AdaptiveCards** nuget package defines a class hierachy for working with adaptive cards in .NET

### To install
```
nuget install AdaptiveCards 
```

### Example creating 
```csharp
var card = new AdaptiveCard();
card.Body.Add(new TextBlock() 
{
    Text = "Hello",
    Size = TextSizes.ExtraLarge,
    Color = TextColor.Attention
});
card.Body.Add(new Image() 
{
    Url = "http://someUrl.com/example.png"
});
```
### Example saving using JSON.Net
```csharp
var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(card);
```

### Example loading using JSON.Net
```csharp
var card = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<AdaptiveCard>(json);
```
