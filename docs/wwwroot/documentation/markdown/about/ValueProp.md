# Value proposition for devlopers
If you are a developer we think you are going to love adaptive cards.

## Content producers
If you are a developer that wants to create content:
* **One card** - You get one format, minimizing the cost of creating a card and maximizing the number of places it can be used.
* **Richer Expression** - Your content can more closely align with want you want to say because you have a richer pallete to paint in.
* **Broader Reach** - Your content will work across a broader set of applications without you having to learn new schemas.
* **Better tooling** - Because there is a shared card ecosystem better tooling can be created that is shared by everyone.

## Content consumers
If you are a developer that owns an application that would like to display cards
* **Easy to implement** - You get off the shelf libraries to easily integrate 
* **Consistent user experience** - You get a consistent experience because you own the style of the rendered card
* **Native performance** - You get native performance as it targets your ui framework directly
* **Safe** - Content is delivered in safe payload, you don't have to open up your ui framework to raw html
* **Free documentation** - You save time because you don't have invent schema, document schema, creating tooling around it, etc.
* **Shared tooling** - You save time because you don't have tooling for your schema
