# Goals 
Adaptive cards goals are to be:

* **Portable** - to any device and ui framework
* **Open** - Libraries and schema are open source and shared.
* **Automatically Styled** to the Host application UX and brand guidelines
* **Low cost** - Easy to define, easy to consume
* **Expressive** - Targeted at the long tail of content that developers want to produce.
* **Purely declarative** - no code is needed or allowed
